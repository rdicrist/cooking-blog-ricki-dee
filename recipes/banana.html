<p>Ingredients:
o	3 large bananas
o	1/2 cup white sugar
o	1 to 2 tablespoons brown sugar
o	juice of 1 lime
o	1 to 2 tablespoons water
o	salt to taste (at least 1/2 teaspoon though)
o	1 tablespoon dark rum
o	1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:

I.	Combine bananas and sugars in a medium pot, smash together with a potato masher (or fork if you don’t have one) to your desired consistency

II.	Set over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until its nice and goopy

III.	Add lime juice, water, and salt. Put lime juice in first. Start with one tablespoon water, but add another if there isn’t enough liquid to allow it to simmer. Salt to taste (I put a ton in mine by accident, so I had to balance it out with more brown sugar). 

IV.	Bring mixture to a simmer (big slow bubbles at least- not sure if that is technically a simmer?) for about 5 minutes.

V.	Stir in rum and vanilla. Simmer for another 5 minutes, or until super incorporated and the alcohol has mostly burned off.

VI.	Spoon the hot jam into jars as quickly as you can (helps it set better). Bananas are NOT safe to can, so keep in the fridge for 3 - 6 months. 

OPTIONAL: If you want your jam super thick and set, add about 1/2 teaspoon pectin. If you don’t add it, cook it a little longer until it reaches the consistency you want. When it cools it’ll get thicker.
