Hummus
- [ ] Can chickpeas (undrained)
- [ ] Tahini 
- [ ] Garlic
- [ ] Lemon
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] Water

ADDITIONAL: cayenne pepper, dill, honey, pepper, olives, whatever u want 

Start with filling a food processor with half a can of chickpeas, a scoop of tahini, 2 cloves of garlic (pressed), half a squeezed lemon, pinch of salt

Pulse for a long period of time (30 second+ batches), add in olive oil / water as needed to make it more cohesive 

Taste and add in ingredients as needed! Use whatever additions you want, I used a few squirts of honey and a few pinches of cayenne to mine! 

Continue pulsing together until a cohesive but thick hummus emerges

Tips:
- [ ] Too “chickpea-y”: add more lemon
- [ ] Too lemony: add more chick peas or garlic
- [ ] Too thick: add in water / olive oil
