
Amatriciana
Ingredients:
•	Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) - enough to cover the bottom of the pot
•	GARLIC: 2 small cloves or 1 big clove.
•	ONION: 1 tennis ball sized onion.
•	PORK: the original recipe calls for “Guanciale” (cured pig cheek), but for our version we will use (~320g-350g) smoked BACON (I use hickory wood).
•	TOMATOES: I will use ~800g (1lb 12oz) of fresh campari tomatoes, but alternatively 2lb of canned diced tomatoes or a combo of 1lb of canned diced tomatoes with 6oz of canned tomato sauce also work. Different tomatoes will yield different flavors and different cooking times. Using canned tomato sauce will make the recipe much faster, but that also means that the tomato will have less time to capture the essence of the other ingredients.
•	PEPERONCINO - Red pepper flakes (as desired)
•	PECORINO: this is a salty dried cheese that you can find in stores as “Pecorino Romano” (Roman pecorino). This has a strong flavor, but Roman dishes are not for the weak. Nonetheless, it is acceptable to pair it (or substitute part of it) with some Parmigiano Reggiano (even worse, some local parmesan) to mitigate its strong flavor. In Rome, this is blasphemy, but I assume most of you are already heretics, so egh!  
•	PASTA: Bucatini or Rigatoni are the classic types to pair with this sauce. The above portions will provide enough sauce for a well covered 400g of pasta, but you can go down to 320g if you love your pasta soaked in sauce. For American stomachs we recommend 80g each, but if you’re feeling Italian go for 100g (I’ll do 200g for myself cause I love it). Recommended brands of pasta widely available in the US are De Cecco (what I will be using), Garofalo, and (to a lesser extent) Barilla.  
•	Salt -  sea salt is used to salt the pasta water after it begins to boil. Not too much for this sauce though as the pecorino is already very salty.
Recipe:

1.	Pour enough EVOO to cover the pot's base and start heating it up. Peel the garlic cloves. When the oil is heated, slant the pot so as to create a pool of oil where you can immerse your garlic. Add the garlic at a medium low temperature in order to avoid the garlic from quickly burning.
2.	While the garlic is gently frying, dice your onion. To do so, you can cut the extremities off, slice it in half vertically, and begin slicing towards the half's center following a grid system (first one side, then the other). When the garlic is yellowish, a bit golden but not brown, ADD the diced onion.
3.	Mix and let it simmer (low temperature) until the onion loses all its hardness and "melts" as much as possible  before it starts turning brown. It will take around 20 minutes of periodic stirring to avoid any burning.
4.	While the onion is simmering, cut your bacon in rectangles eliminating excess fat. When the onion reaches its golden moment, ADD the bacon and mix. Let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until it all changes color and the fat melts to produce a little bit of liquid (see pic 1).
5.	While the bacon is cooking, cut the tomatoes in eighths (or fourths if eights is too hard).
6.	Once the bacon changes color, ADD the tomatoes, mix, raise the temperature to medium and cover for 5 to 10 minutes (mix periodically). The goal is to get the tomatoes to soften and create a bit of a sauce so that you will go from mixing to stirring. 
7.	Once stirring status is achieved, you can lower the temperature to a simmer and press the tomatoes with a presser or a fork. This will help get the juice out faster.
8.	The long simmering period begins. ADD the desired amount of red pepper flakes and salt, but keep in mind that the pecorino will be salty and that the spiciness of the pepper increases as the sauce's water evaporates.
9.	Stir and taste every so often to gauge the status and needs of your sauce (show it your love).
10.	The simmering process should last at least one hour and can go on as long as you want. Ideally the sauce will produce big slow bubbles (see pic 2) until it loses most of its volume. Judge whether the sauce is ready by dipping bread into it and using your palate as a guiding tool (it should look like Pic 3 after you stir it).
11.	Start warming the pasta water when you notice that the liquid in the sauce has almost disappeared. Once the water starts boiling, ADD a half handful of salt to the water and throw the pasta (feel free to choose your own levels of salt, though at least some is necessary).
12.	When you see the sauce is ready, lower the temperature to one that will keep the sauce warm without cooking as you wait for the pasta to be done.
13.	Follow the instructions on the box to get the perfect pasta "al dente." Usually, you can time 10 minutes and begin tasting the pasta then to stop it at the right moment. Do this by biting into the pasta and looking into its body. When uncooked, the pasta will have a clear white line (or dot if you are using spaghetti) in its center. Pasta is cooked to perfection when this line is faint but still visible (this is because the pasta will cook itself a bit more even after it is strained).
14.	Strain your perfectly cooked pasta making sure all the water is gone and pour it in your serving bowl. Pour the Amatriciana sauce on top of it, helping yourself with a spatula or wooden spoon to get it all out of the pot, and then ADD a handful of pecorino. Mix. Add another handful of pecorino. Mix. Then judge if it needs more pecorino to better stick the sauce to the pasta. If not, add the last handful of pecorino on top of the pasta as garnish. Leave enough pecorino aside to allow you and your table guests to add as desired.
15.	Voila, your amatriciana is ready! Enjoy! I'm so hungry now!
