            <ol type="I">
                <li>Remove skins and pits from peaches (using whatever method you want) and cut into roughly ½ inch chunks</li>
                <li>Add lemon juice to peaches and put them into large pot on medium-low heat</li>
                <li>Cover pot for 3 – 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Take cover off and heat an additional 3 – 5 minutes, until peaches are soft enough to mash</li>
                <li>Take pot off heat and mash with a potato masher</li>
                <li>Repeat steps until you have desired consistency, using a rotary beater if desired</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>NOTE: you will be mashing a final time at the end, so it doesn’t have to be perfect</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Mix sugar, cinnamon, and pectin and add to pot, turning heat to medium-low</li>
                <li>Stir well and cook, stirring constantly, until the flavors have melded (taste constantly)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>NOTE: adjust ingredients to taste, start with smallest amount and gradually add until you have the flavor / consistency you want</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Bring to medium-high heat and bring to a boil</li>

                <li>Take pot off heat and mash a final time</li>
                <li>Use ladle to scoop jam into mason jars of desired size, making sure to get an even distribution of fruit chunks</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>	
            <strong>Notes:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Taste often!! All the ingredients are adjustable, except you have to keep at least a one-half-to-one sugar-to-fruit ratio</li>
                <li>Jam will get firmer after it cools</li>
                <li>Eat within ~4 months~ of cooking, keep refrigerated</li>
            </ul>
