        <div class="width"><p>I had a dream. A dream to look up a recipe on the internet and not be assaulted with 
            long blog posts about the day to day life of the author. I do not care what your "hubby"s 
            favorite recipe is. I do not care what season or childhood memory it reminds you of. I 
            do not care about your personal journey of making this recipe.
            I just want to see the ingredients and the steps.
